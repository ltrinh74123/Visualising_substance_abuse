# Visualising_substance_abuse

This is a submission to USYD's Matildas Data Visualisation where we were supposed to collect sufficient and clean data for our uses. The competition's goal is to visualize the data in order to convey a story or draw attention to a pressing problem with mental health or substance misuse. Therefore, I decided to create a visualization of illegal drug use in Australia with the aim of enabling policy-makers to focus their efforts on communities that may be more likely to abuse illicit drugs. This was accomplished by examining the proportion of recent usage in various age and gender groups and more specific drug classes within each state.
