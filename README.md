# Visualising_substance_abuse

This is a submission to USYD's Matildas Data Visualisation where we were supposed to collect sufficient and clean data for our uses. The competition's goal is to visualize the data in order to convey a story or draw attention to a pressing problem with mental health or substance misuse. Therefore, I decided to create a visualization of illegal drug use in Australia with the aim of enabling policymakers to focus their efforts on communities that may be more likely to abuse illicit drugs. This was accomplished by examining the proportion of recent usage in various age and gender groups and more specific drug classes within each state.

In terms of experience, this is my second time using Shiny to create an interactive dashboard, where I tried exploring the different UI options and making my own CSS for the color schemes for a 'dark mode' as I wasn't confident to do it before in my first project. Moreover, rather than using the different ways to select an input such as buttons or slider that is integrated into Shiny UI, I wanted to experiment with capturing the user's mouse movement and using that as an input which can be seen by clicking on the different states in the map.
